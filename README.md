Particle Physics
===============
Particle Physics is being split off from Minechem. If you're upgrading to ParticlePhysics from Minechem pre-5.0.5-Dev4, please read about [how to upgrade](http://jakimfett.com/status-report/splitting-minechem/).

You can [download the latest Particle Physics builds from Jenkins](http://jenkins.jakimfett.com/build/job/ParticlePhysics/). Please report any bugs, and be aware that Particle Physics isn't quite stable yet.

The basic principles can be seen in [BevoLJ's showcase of Minechem and Particle Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=V_J7eruam9A#t=1058).
